Google AI Challenge Bot
=======================

Bot that participated in 2010's Google AI Challenge. Best rank was #100 (from more than 4.000 participations all in all). Final rank was ~ #250 since I did not maintain it until the finale.

I was pretty amazed that I was able to acutally perform pretty well in the competition. Therefore, once my bot had reached the top 100 I stopped developing it. Following the principle "never change a running system" I was afraid of hurting its performance more than improving it with any further changes to the code. Instead I focused on writing a client for the game in C#. Therefore other bots outperformed mine at the end of the competition. However, being amongst the best 300 still was great since more than 4.000 developers participated.

Code comments are in German. `MyBot.cs` is the core file of my bot, the other files are templates that have been created by the makers of the challenge.
